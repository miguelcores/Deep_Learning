# Deep_Learning
In this repository I am going to tackle an image caption model.

To do so, I am going to implement the following architecture:

- Image feature extractor CNN: InceptionV3 (without the classification layer)
- Text generator RNN: LSTM.

** Lastly I am going to see how Beam Search algorithm performs when applied to LSTM text generator models.
